# Intermittent-Learning
This repository provides an implementation for the paper 'intermittent learning on harvested energy'. It is written for the MSP430FR5994 microprocessor with an energy harvester. You can download and compile source code by using Code Composer Studio (Version: 7.4.0.00015).

1. intermittent_NN - an example code of intermittent feed-forward neural network. Back-propagation with multiple layers are supported based on supervision.

2. intermittent_learning - a template code for intermittent learning. Each action function is provided with an empty template. You can fill the action functions with your own machine learning algorithm.
